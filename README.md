# Facial-Recognition
This project involved using the percentage width and percentage height that an individual's facial features covered in comparison to the face. I implemented a KNN algorithm to label unknown data points with the correct facial feature being emoted (either a frown or a smile). Lastly, I optimized the KNN algorithm via the parameter K.
